889307941125736_1343809752342217,"Hillary for America general counsel Marc Elias on listening and responding to calls for an audit and recount:

""Over the last few days, officials in the Clinton campaign have received hundreds of messages, emails, and calls urging us to do something, anything, to investigate claims that the election results were hacked and altered in a way to disadvantage Secretary Clinton. The concerns have arisen, in particular, with respect to Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania — three states that together proved decisive in this presidential election and where the combined margin of victory for Donald Trump was merely 107,000 votes.

It should go without saying that we take these concerns extremely seriously. We certainly understand the heartbreak felt by so many who worked so hard to elect Hillary Clinton, and it is a fundamental principle of our democracy to ensure that every vote is properly counted.

Moreover, this election cycle was unique in the degree of foreign interference witnessed throughout the campaign: the U.S. government concluded that Russian state actors were behind the hacks of the Democratic National Committee and the personal email accounts of Hillary for America campaign officials, and just yesterday, the Washington Post reported that the Russian government was behind much of the ""fake news"" propaganda that circulated online in the closing weeks of the election.

For all these reasons, we have quietly taken a number of steps in the last two weeks to rule in or out any possibility of outside interference in the vote tally in these critical battleground states.
First, since the day after the election we have had lawyers and data scientists and analysts combing over the results to spot anomalies that would suggest a hacked result. These have included analysts both from within the campaign and outside, with backgrounds in politics, technology and academia.

Second, we have had numerous meetings and calls with various outside experts to hear their concerns and to discuss and review their data and findings. As a part of this, we have also shared out data and findings with them. Most of those discussions have remained private, while at least one has unfortunately been the subject of leaks.

Third, we have attempted to systematically catalogue and investigate every theory that has been presented to us within our ability to do so.

Fourth, we have examined the laws and practices as they pertain to recounts, contests and audits.

Fifth, and most importantly, we have monitored and staffed the post-election canvasses — where voting machine tapes are compared to poll-books, provisional ballots are resolved, and all of the math is double checked from election night. During that process, we have seen Secretary Clinton's vote total grow, so that, today, her national popular vote lead now exceeds more than 2 million votes.

In the coming days, we will continue to perform our due diligence and actively follow all further activities that are to occur prior to the certification of any election results. For instance, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania conduct post-election audits using a sampling of precincts. Michigan and many other states still do not. This is unfortunate; it is our strong belief that, in addition to an election canvass, every state should do this basic audit to ensure accuracy and public confidence in the election.

Beyond the post-election audit, Green Party candidate Jill Stein announced Friday that she will exercise her right as a candidate to pursue a recount in the state of Wisconsin. She has indicated plans to also seek recounts in Pennsylvania and Michigan.

Because we had not uncovered any actionable evidence of hacking or outside attempts to alter the voting technology, we had not planned to exercise this option ourselves, but now that a recount has been initiated in Wisconsin, we intend to participate in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides. If Jill Stein follows through as she has promised and pursues recounts in Pennsylvania and Michigan, we will take the same approach in those states as well. We do so fully aware that the number of votes separating Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in the closest of these states — Michigan — well exceeds the largest margin ever overcome in a recount. But regardless of the potential to change the outcome in any of the states, we feel it is important, on principle, to ensure our campaign is legally represented in any court proceedings and represented on the ground in order to monitor the recount process itself.

The campaign is grateful to all those who have expended time and effort to investigate various claims of abnormalities and irregularities. While that effort has not, in our view, resulted in evidence of manipulation of results, now that a recount is underway, we believe we have an obligation to the more than 64 million Americans who cast ballots for Hillary Clinton to participate in ongoing proceedings to ensure that an accurate vote count will be reported.""",,status,,https://www.facebook.com/hillaryclinton/posts/1343809752342217,2016-11-26 23:28:38,176288,22953,24013,149884,20590,2977,1524,208,1105

889307941125736_1324421317614394,"Last night, I congratulated Donald Trump and offered to work with him on behalf of our country. I hope that he will be a successful president for all Americans.

This is not the outcome we wanted or we worked so hard for, and I'm sorry we did not win this election for the values we share and the vision we hold for our country.

But I feel pride and gratitude for this wonderful campaign that we built together—this vast, diverse, creative, unruly, energized campaign. You represent the best of America, and being your candidate has been one of the greatest honors of my life.

I know how disappointed you feel, because I feel it too. And so do tens of millions of Americans who invested their hopes and dreams in this effort. This is painful, and it will be for a long time. But I want you to remember this: Our campaign was never about one person or even one election. It was about the country we love—and about building an America that's hopeful, inclusive, and big-hearted.

We have seen that our nation is more deeply divided than we thought. But I still believe in America—and I always will. And if you do, too, then we must accept this result—and then look to the future.

Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead.

Our constitutional democracy enshrines the peaceful transfer of power, and we don't just respect that, we cherish it. It also enshrines other things—the rule of law, the principle that we're all equal in rights and dignity, and the freedom of worship and expression. We respect and cherish these things too—and we must defend them.

And let me add: Our constitutional democracy demands our participation, not just every four years, but all the time. So let's do all we can to keep advancing the causes and values we all hold dear: making our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top; protecting our country and protecting our planet; and breaking down all the barriers that hold anyone back from achieving their dreams.

We've spent a year and a half bringing together millions of people from every corner of our country to say with one voice that we believe that the American Dream is big enough for everyone—for people of all races and religions, for men and women, for immigrants, for LGBT people, and people with disabilities. Our responsibility as citizens is to keep doing our part to build that better, stronger, fairer America we seek. And I know you will. I am so grateful to stand with all of you.

I want to thank Tim Kaine and Anne Holton for being our partners on this journey. It gives me great hope and comfort to know that Tim will remain on the front-lines of our democracy, representing Virginia in the Senate.

To Barack and Michelle Obama: Our country owes you an enormous debt of gratitude for your graceful, determined leadership, and so do I.

To Bill, Chelsea, Marc, Charlotte, Aidan, our brothers, and our entire family, my love for you means more than I can ever express.
You crisscrossed this country on my behalf and lifted me up when I needed it most—even 4-month-old Aidan traveling with his mom.

I will always be grateful to the creative, talented, dedicated men and women at our headquarters in Brooklyn and across our country who poured their hearts into this campaign. For you veterans, this was a campaign after a campaign — for some of you, this was your first campaign ever. I want each of you to know that you were the best campaign anyone has had.

To all the volunteers, community leaders, activists, and union organizers who knocked on doors, talked to neighbors, posted on Facebook—even in secret or in private: Thank you.

To everyone who sent in contributions as small as $5 and kept us going, thank you.

And to all the young people in particular, I want you to hear this. I've spent my entire adult life fighting for what I believe in. I've had successes and I've had setbacks—sometimes really painful ones. Many of you are at the beginning of your careers. You will have successes and setbacks, too.

This loss hurts. But please, please never stop believing that fighting for what's right is worth it. It's always worth it. And we need you keep up these fights now and for the rest of your lives.

To all the women, and especially the young women, who put their faith in this campaign and in me, I want you to know that nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion.

I know that we still have not shattered that highest glass ceiling. But some day someone will—hopefully sooner than we might think right now.

And to all the little girls watching right now, never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world.

Finally, I am grateful to our country for all it has given me.
I count my blessings every day that I am an American. And I still believe, as deeply as I ever have, that if we stand together and work together, with respect for our differences, strength in our convictions, and love for this nation—our best days are still ahead of us.

You know I believe we are stronger together and will go forward together. And you should never be sorry that you fought for that.
Scripture tells us: ""Let us not grow weary in doing good, for in due season, we shall reap, if we do not lose heart.""

My friends, let us have faith in each other. Let us not grow weary. Let us not lose heart. For there are more seasons to come and there is more work to do.

I am incredibly honored and grateful to have had this chance to represent all of you in this consequential election. May God bless you and God bless the United States of America.",,status,,https://www.facebook.com/hillaryclinton/posts/1324421317614394,2016-11-09 13:51:57,1105770,76698,151037,779710,174981,1423,5562,142240,1854

That's her North Star. That's what guides her. She believes in that. She believes we can summon what's best in each of us and make this country better for all of us.  

That's what America is about. We are a country like no other not because of the size of our skyscrapers or the power of our armies, but because we are a place founded for the sake of an idea. 'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights.' We don't have to be born into wealth or privilege in this country. We don't have to practice a certain faith. We don't have to have a certain last name. We just have to be willing to contribute. We just have to be willing to put our shoulder to the wheel of history, and we can be a part of this community that we call America.  

That's what drove patriots to choose revolution over tyranny. That's what led GIs to liberate a continent. That's what gave women the courage to reach for the ballot. That's what gave marchers the courage to cross a bridge in Selma. That's what allowed workers to organize for collective bargaining and better wages. That's what made America exceptional. That's what makes America great.  

In other words, America depends on you—you, all of you. America has never been about what one person says he'll do for us. I didn't say 'Yes, I can.' I said, 'Yes, we can.' It's about what can be achieved by us, each of us, together, through that hard, slow, and, yes, sometimes frustrating work of self-government.

You just got to vote. And the nice thing is, you don't just have to vote against that guy because you've got a candidate who is actually worthy of your vote—who is smart, and who is steady, and who is tested, is probably the most qualified person ever to run for this office, and that is the next President of the United States, Hillary Clinton.

Hillary, she just works through whatever is in front of her. She's got grit and she's got resilience. And if she gets knocked down, she just comes back up and she goes back at it. And she knows, most importantly, what the decisions that a President makes means to you.  

This isn't abstract stuff we're talking about here. If you're a student, whether you get a Pell grant or were able to make sure that you don't have a mountain of debt when you get out of school, that depends on decisions that are made in part by the President. If you're a soldier, whether you get deployed to some far-off land, that is up to the Commander-in-Chief. If you're a young person who was brought to this country as a child, has grown up as an American but maybe doesn't have the papers and now you're trying to figure out how you can contribute to this country you call home, that is something the President has influence over. Veterans, seniors, a single mom who needs some help with child care—that's what these decisions are about. And Hillary understands that, and she knows those folks need a champion.

And she's actually got plans to help. She's actually got plans. The other guy is not a big plan guy. She's got plans. She can show you how she's going to make sure more people have early childhood education. She's going to show how young people can have more affordable college education. And while she's executing those plans, she's also going to respect working Americans and the values we care about."" —President Obama",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/hillaryclinton/photos/a.889773484412515.1073741828.889307941125736/1313029225420270/?type=3,https://www.facebook.com/hillaryclinton/posts/1313029225420270:0,2016-11-04 08:30:02,35158,5703,3358,31234,3455,64,254,8,143

""As of this morning, the Washington Post-ABC News tracking poll has us down one point. As of yesterday, Trump's odds of winning had climbed to above 1-in-4, per Nate Silver's projections. And he seems to be making up ground in Florida, according to a whole slew of polls. The truth is that Trump has a real, viable path to 270 electoral votes.

We have a very small window of time left to try to deploy resources to our battleground states that it will take to guarantee a win. So I'm asking you: Can you be one of the people we need on Facebook to step up and chip in to our GOTV Fund today to try to make sure we prove this poll an outlier come Tuesday?

This is the most consequential election in our lifetimes. Even a dollar today shows that you're fighting for Hillary: hrc.io/2ec2HcJ

""By now, you've probably heard some news about a bewildering letter sent to Congressional leaders by the Director of the FBI. This is all a bit confusing, and much of the reporting has been misleading or downright inaccurate, so I want to take a minute to walk through this. 

Here's the quick backstory: In July, FBI Director Jim Comey concluded a year-long investigation by deciding not to go forward with any case about Hillary's emails. It wasn't even a close call, he said. In his words, 'no reasonable prosecutor' would have brought charges.

Yesterday, in a surprise to us all, Comey wrote a very strange letter to Congress that was long on innuendo and short on facts. He said that in a completely separate investigation, the FBI had found some emails that may or may not be related to Hillary, and indeed may or may not be significant at all.

It's being reported that Comey sent this letter over the objections of Department of Justice officials who told him that it was inconsistent with longstanding policy of both Democratic and Republican administrations not to take action that might impact an election. It's an unprecedented intrusion into a close presidential election with less than 11 days until Election Day.
 
Voters deserve answers.

Comey needs to come clean with the American people about what he found and answer all the questions about why he took this unprecedented step less than weeks before the election.

Here's what this changes for you and this campaign: Absolutely nothing.

The facts be damned—Trump's always shown a complete disregard for the truth. In spite of there being no new information, he's already raising money off the bizarre letter (he literally sent a text message asking for money within an hour of the story breaking!) and he's more fired up than ever on the trail today.

These are the actions of a desperate man. Trump knows he can't win on his character, temperament, or his policies. He's behind, so he'll cling to whatever he can. We can't let him get away with this.

Our organizers and volunteers on the ground are rallying behind Hillary in what will be the biggest volunteer weekend of the campaign so far. You need to have her back, too. You need to say you're not willing to let Trump bully or buy his way into the presidency, and you're not going to let anything stop us from making history.

There are ten days to go. Let's buckle down, stay focused, and win this. Chip in here: hrc.io/donatenow""",,status,,https://www.facebook.com/hillaryclinton/posts/1303309199725606,2016-10-29 18:38:01,40212,8823,4445,35851,3186,122,679,63,311

The contrast couldn't be starker: Tim will lay out his and Hillary's vision for our country that says we're stronger when we work together and help all Americans get ahead, while Pence will take the stage as the running mate to the most divisive, unqualified candidate in history.

Throughout this campaign, Donald Trump has spouted hateful, nonsensical policy ideas and used unhinged rhetoric unfit for a Commander-in-Chief. He's called immigrants """"rapists"""" and ""criminals,"" proposed a ban on Muslims entering the country, demeaned women and said they should be punished for getting an abortion, insulted our veterans, and the list goes on.

And the scary thing is, Mike Pence has actually implemented a lot of the dangerous ideas Trump supports in Congress and as governor of Indiana—from defunding Planned Parenthood and all but eliminating access to safe and legal abortion, to codifying discrimination against LGBT people and outlawing higher minimum wages.

So tonight, Pence faces a choice: Will he fall on his sword to defend Trump's indefensible and offensive policies and statements, or will he hang his running mate out to dry? Will he ignore the facts and back up Trump's lies, or will he acknowledge the truth on some of Trump's biggest falsehoods?

Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur are a time for prayer and contemplation. They are a time to recall our past year, take a hard look at what we've done and what we've said, and ask how we can do better in the year ahead.  They challenge us to do the difficult work of self-reflection—key to becoming a better family member, friend, and neighbor.

Our country must do this work as a national community, too. All Americans should question whether we're doing all that we can to work on Tikkun Olam—repairing the world. That means asking ourselves if we could be doing more to help those who are hungry or in need of shelter. If we could be doing more to make sure everyone has access to health care. And if we could be doing more to build a brighter future where no one is left out or left behind. 

It's critical to ask these tough questions. And then, at the conclusion of the High Holidays, it's even more important to get to work and answer them.

Many of the complex challenges we face as a nation are daunting—but luckily, we don't have to face them alone. We are stronger together, and if we commit to work in good faith with one another, surely we can build a better world for future generations.

This year's High Holidays are saddened by the passing of President Shimon Peres, a man whose life's work exemplifies the notion of Tikkun Olam. Let us honor his legacy by continuing to strengthen the bonds between the American and Israeli people, and by never wavering in our quest for peace.

May the coming year be filled with sweetness and joy.",,status,,https://www.facebook.com/hillaryclinton/posts/1267594233297103,2016-10-02 17:56:18,22112,1742,1804,20062,1947,23,51,8,21

Alicia merece respeto por hacerle frente con valentía a los ataques de Trump. ¿Y él tiene el descaro de culparla de su propio comportamiento cruel y hasta decir que él la ""ayudó""?

Cuando algo le molesta, Donald reacciona agresivamente y no lo puede dejar ir. Esta es una cualidad peligrosa para un candidato presidencial; y ni hablar de un presidente.

Es más: este es un patrón de arremeter contra mujeres que desafían, critican o de alguna manera desagradan a Trump. Para Donald, mujeres como Alicia tan sólo valen dependiendo de la opinión que él tiene de sus imagen.. Él hostiga obsesivamente a Rosie O'Donnell, una actriz de mérito. Llama ""locas"" y ""neuróticas"" o cosas peores, a las reporteras y a las nuevas conductoras de programas de noticias que lo cuestionan. Insultó a Kim Kardashian acerca de su peso ─ cuando ella estaba embarazada. Es patético.

Hemos escuchado los insultos de Donald por años y sus políticas reflejan esta indiferencia e incluso desprecio hacia las mujeres:

Sobre la igualdad salarial, Trump dice que las mujeres sólo deben ""hacer un trabajo tan bueno como el de los hombres"". Él piensa que las mujeres que tienen un aborto deben ser ""castigadas"". Llamó al embarazo una ""inconveniencia"" para los empleadores. ¿Las esposas que trabajan son ""peligrosas.""

I think that complacency is how we've ended up very far from our September fundraising goal with just hours to go. I don't want to wake up on November 9 knowing we could have done more—or worse, knowing we would have done more if we'd only had the resources we needed.

What kind of man stays up all night to smear a woman with lies and conspiracy theories? Alicia deserves praise for courageously standing up to Trump's attacks. And he has the gall to blame her for his cruel behavior—and even say he ""helped""? 

When something gets under Donald's thin skin, he lashes out and can't let go. This is dangerous for a presidential candidate, never mind a president.

What's more: This is a pattern of flying off the handle at women who defy, criticize, or otherwise displease Trump. To Donald, women like Alicia are only as valuable as his personal opinion about their looks. He obsessively bullies Rosie O'Donnell, an accomplished actor. He calls female reporters and news hosts who question him ""crazy"" and ""neurotic,"" or worse. He insulted Kim Kardashian for her weight—when she was pregnant. It's pathetic. 

We've heard Donald's insults for years, and his policies reflect this disregard—even contempt—for women:

On equal pay, Trump says women should just ""do as good a job"" as men. He thinks women who get an abortion should be ""punished."" He called pregnancy an ""inconvenience"" to employers. Wives working are ""dangerous.""

He's never hidden how he truly feels about women, but it's never been clearer than right now: he doesn't respect half the population of this country—and he doesn't deserve to lead it.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/hillaryclinton/photos/a.889773484412515.1073741828.889307941125736/1264571383599388/?type=3,https://www.facebook.com/hillaryclinton/posts/1264571383599388:0,2016-09-30 12:20:49,64390,8288,10597,49800,2352,1279,606,444,9909

No, she gets right back up, and she comes back stronger for the people who need her the most. And here is what is also true—and I want you all to think about this: Hillary is one of the few people on this entire planet—and clearly the only person in this race—who has any idea what this job entails, who has seen it from every angle. Hear me: the staggering stakes, the brutal hours, the overwhelming stresses. And here's the thing—she still wants to take it on. See, because she believes that she has an obligation to use her talents to help as many people as possible. That is why she's running.

""Now, let me tell you, that is what dedication looks like. That is what love of country looks like. So when I hear folks saying they don't feel inspired in this election—well, let me tell you, I disagree. I am inspired. Because for eight years, I have had the privilege to see what it takes to actually do this job. And here's what I absolutely know for sure: Right now, we have an opportunity to elect one of the most qualified people who has ever endeavored to become president. Hillary has been a lawyer, a law professor, First Lady of Arkansas, First Lady of the United States, a U.S. Senator, Secretary of State. That's why I'm inspired by Hillary. I'm inspired by her persistence and her consistency, by her heart and her guts. And I'm inspired by her lifelong record of public service. No one in our lifetime has ever had as much experience and exposure to the presidency—not Barack; not Bill. And, yes, happens to be a woman.  

""So we cannot afford to squander this opportunity, particularly given the alternative. Because here is what we know—that beingpresident isn't anything like reality TV. It's not about sending insulting tweets or making fiery speeches. It's about whether or not the candidate can handle the awesome responsibility of leading this country. So, ask yourselves: Which candidate really has the experience, the maturity, and the demeanor to handle the job I described to you? Which candidate's words and actions speak to the future we want for our country and the values we share—values like inclusion and opportunity, service and sacrifice for others? Your answers to these questions on Election Day will determine who sits in the Oval Office after Barack Obama."" —First Lady Michelle Obama yesterday in Virginia",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/hillaryclinton/photos/a.889773484412515.1073741828.889307941125736/1250132235043303/?type=3,https://www.facebook.com/hillaryclinton/posts/1250132235043303:0,2016-09-17 17:56:43,44232,2660,5978,38176,5721,100,172,7,56

Leading the birther movement is deplorable. Attempting to say it ""did a great service"" to the president who Trump attacked is asinine. When Trump tries to deflect blame for denying that President Obama was born in America, he is lying.

Again, Trump turns his faults on others. Psychologists call it ""projecting."" Kids call it ""I'm rubber, you're glue."" This shouldn't have to be said: You don't just get to say someone else did the worst things you've done. It doesn't work. No one buys it.

Trump has spent years peddling a racist conspiracy aimed at undermining the first African American president. He can't just take it back. The birther lie is what turned Trump from an ordinary reality TV star into a political figure. That origin story can't be unwritten. Trump's birtherism stems from the same innate beliefs that led to discriminating against black tenants early in his career. That can't be undone.

889307941125736_1248391811884012,"It was great to be back on the campaign trail yesterday. As you may know, I recently had a cough that turned out to be pneumonia. I tried to power through it, but even I had to admit that maybe a few days of rest would do me good.

I'm not great at taking it easy, even under ordinary circumstances, and sitting home was pretty much the last place I wanted to be with just two months until Election Day.

But having a few days to myself was actually a gift. I talked with some old friends and spent time with our very sweet dogs. And I did some thinking. The campaign trail doesn't really encourage reflection, and it's important to sit with your thoughts every now and then.

People like me—we're lucky. When I'm under the weather, I can afford to take a few days off. Millions of Americans can't. They either go to work sick, or they lose a paycheck.

Lots of Americans still don't even have insurance—or they do, but it's too expensive to actually use. So they toss back Tylenols, chug orange juice, and hope that cough or cold or virus goes away on its own.

And lots of working parents can't afford child care. It costs as much as college tuition in many states, so millions of moms and dads have no backup if they get sick—they're on their own. I've met so many people living on a razor's edge—one illness away from losing their job, one paycheck away from losing their home.

Events like these are mere bumps in the road for some families—but for others, they are catastrophic. And that disparity goes against everything we stand for as Americans.

Some things shouldn't come down to luck. Some things should be within reach for every American, no matter what—like financial security, affordable health care, and the peace of mind that comes with knowing that if something goes wrong, your family will be okay.

That's why I got into this race: to fight for everyone working hard, often against the odds, to support their families and contribute to our country. I want to tear down all the barriers standing in their way.

I'm running for the factory workers and food servers who on their feet all day—and the nurses looking after patients all night. I'm running for the young people who dream of changing our country and world for the better, and I'm running for all the parents and grandparents supporting those dreams by dedicating every dollar they can to their education.

Now, we're in the final stretch. There are just 53 days left. I'm going to be campaigning hard all the way until Election Day, talking about my ideas for our country everywhere I go—from reining in Wall Street to creating good-paying jobs to, yes, guaranteed paid family leave, so that no one in this country ever has to choose between taking care of their family (or themselves) and a paycheck.

We need a president who's spent years fighting for these issues, and who has a plan to support all families, in all their configurations. And if I have the honor of serving as your president, no one will fight harder for your children and your families—because this is the work of my life, and I'm not stopping now.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/hillaryclinton/photos/a.889773484412515.1073741828.889307941125736/1248391811884012/?type=3,https://www.facebook.com/hillaryclinton/posts/1248391811884012:0,2016-09-16 07:00:01,64964,5272,7051,55969,8589,170,129,14,93

Not only did the moderator, Matt Lauer, fail to fact-check Trump—he then kept the conversation moving.

The worst part is, there's nothing new about this happening. We all know that Trump lies a lot. And we all know that many outlets in the press apparently lack the wherewithal to call him out—and help voters understand that what they're hearing from Trump isn't just normal political talk, but an unprecedented descent into unqualified nonsense from a major-party presidential nominee.

At this point, we should understand that we just can't sit around and wait for fact checkers in the media to keep Trump honest. We have to step up and do it ourselves. No one will do it for us. And the outcome of the election could hang in the balance.

That means we have to work even harder to get the facts out there on TV, online, and in conversations with voters across the country. We have to speak so loudly that every voter in America hears us.

""I have a dream, that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.""

His call to action sparked the momentum needed to pass the Voting Rights Act—knocking down legal barriers that had stood for generations, and ensuring every American could exercise their constitutional right to vote.

In 2016, we've come a long way since the days of Jim Crow. Yet too many Americans still face systemic racism and constant assaults on their franchise. Something is profoundly wrong when decades after Dr. King addressed the nation, so many Americans still feel that their country values them less, simply because of the color of their skin.

That's just one reason why the stakes in this election are unlike any we have faced before. Those brave men and women who marched, and sat, and bled for civil rights in America must not have done so in vain.

As President, I'll stand up to bluster and bigotry, and fight back against efforts to restrict access to the ballot. Let's make it easier for people to vote, not harder. Let's make sure every state has at least 20 days of in-person voting, and no one ever has to wait more than 30 minutes to cast their ballot. And let's automatically register every American to vote on their 18th birthday.

The power of American democracy comes from the fact that no one is left behind—no matter where they come from, what they look like, or who they love. That's what I mean when I say that we're stronger together.

So today, let's continue to be inspired by the self-evident truths that first united our nation, and live up to what a young minister dreamed and declared fifty-three years ago.",,status,,https://www.facebook.com/hillaryclinton/posts/1228783223844871,2016-08-28 11:07:19,14083,2068,1298,12781,1177,56,30,7,32

889307941125736_1225044860885374,"Millones de estadounidenses con severas alergias dependen de sus EpiPens. Cuando una reacción alérgica lleva a un shock anafiláctico, una inyección de epinefrina puede ser la diferencia entre la vida y la muerte. Pero ahora, cuando los padres están por mandar a la escuela a hijos con severas alergias alimentarias o a insectos, el fabricante de EpiPen está subiendo su precio a un número sin precedente.

A lo largo de los últimos años, Mylan Pharmaceuticals ha incrementado el precio de los EpiPens más del 400%. Ahora están cobrando hasta $600 por un set de dos EpiPens que tiene que ser reemplazado cada 12-18 meses. Esto no solo aumenta los costos de bolsillo de las familias y de los primeros intervinientes sino que también contribuye a un aumento de las primas para todos los estadounidenses y sus empleadores.

Esto es indignante—y es solamente el último ejemplo preocupante de una empresa que se aprovecha de sus consumidores. Yo creo que nuestras industrias farmacéutica y de biotecnología pueden ser una gran fuente de innovación estadounidense, otorgando tratamientos revolucionarios para enfermedades debilitadoras. Pero está mal cuando las empresas farmacéuticas ponen a sus ganancias antes que a sus pacientes, aumentando los precios sin justificar el valor detrás de ellos.

Es por esto que hemos creado un plan, hrc.io/2c7gjuI, para resolver los aumentos exorbitantes en los precios de medicamentos como estos. Como parte de mi plan, he dejado en claro que las compañías farmacéuticas deberían tener que explicar aumentos de precios significativos y demostrar que todos los costos adicionales están relacionados con beneficios adicionales para los pacientes y mejor calidad. Como no hay una justificación evidente en este caso, le pido a Mylan que reduzca inmediatamente el precio de los EpiPens.

Adicionalmente, cuando se trata de tratamientos como suministrar epinefrina que ha estado disponible por décadas, mi plan fomenta la producción de productos alternativos. Así es cómo podemos aprovechar el poder de la competencia para mantener los precios de los medicamentos a niveles a los que todos los estadounidenses puedan acceder.",,status,,https://www.facebook.com/hillaryclinton/posts/1225044860885374,2016-08-24 14:24:40,8353,1928,759,7377,482,42,23,45,384

889307941125736_1224944767562050,"Millions of Americans with severe allergies rely on their EpiPens.  When an allergic reaction leads to anaphylactic shock, a shot of epinephrine can literally be the difference between life and death. But now, just as parents are about to send kids with severe food and insect allergies back to school, the EpiPen's manufacturer is hiking its price to an all-time high.

Over the last several years, Mylan Pharmaceuticals has increased the price of EpiPens by more than 400%. They're now charging up to $600 for a two-EpiPen set that must be replaced every 12-18 months. This both increases out-of-pocket costs for families and first responders, and contributes to higher premiums for all Americans and their employers.

That's outrageous -- and it's just the latest troubling example of a company taking advantage of its consumers. I believe that our pharmaceutical and biotech industries can be an incredible source of American innovation, giving us revolutionary treatments for debilitating diseases. But it's wrong when drug companies put profits ahead of patients, raising prices without justifying the value behind them.

That's why I've put forward a plan, hrc.io/2c7gjuI, to address exorbitant drug price hikes like these. As part of my plan, I've made clear that pharmaceutical manufacturers should be required to explain significant price increases, and prove that any additional costs are linked to additional patient benefits and better value.  Since there is no apparent justification in this case, I am calling on Mylan to immediately reduce the price of EpiPens. 

In addition, when it comes to treatments like delivering epinephrine that have been available for decades, my plan encourages the production of alternative products. That's how we can harness the power of competition to keep drug prices at a level that all Americans can afford.",,status,,https://www.facebook.com/hillaryclinton/posts/1224944767562050,2016-08-24 12:19:21,22635,2598,3242,19761,1429,71,29,116,1229

More than 30,000 people have been rescued by the Coast Guard, National Guard, and other emergency responders. Thousands of people have lost everything. At least 13 lost their lives. We must make sure that all resources are brought to bear in responding to the crisis and helping communities rebuild.

That is why I have called on supporters of this campaign to give what they can to the Red Cross at rdcrss.org/2aYiT5W, to bring much-needed aid and supplies to the more than 100,000 people affected by the floods. We also need to make sure that this crisis is not compounded by another, by ensuring mosquito abatement is happening hand-in-hand with flood response, to reduce the risk of mosquitoes that could carry the Zika virus from gaining a foothold in Louisiana.

The best way to help Louisianans affected by these terrible floods is to make sure they have the resources they need today. I am committed to visiting communities affected by these floods, at a time when the presence of a political campaign will not disrupt the response, to discuss how we can and will rebuild together.

In times of crisis, Americans have always come together to lift each other up, support each other, and rebuild stronger and better than before.

Social Security benefits 59 million Americans today—but Republicans are relentlessly trying to attack and undermine this bedrock American guarantee. They want to cut benefits and gamble seniors' retirement security on the stock market through privatization. 

And Donald Trump is no different—just look who he chose as his running mate. Mike Pence spent his time in Congress championing efforts to dismantle Social Security—and to privatize it even faster than President George W. Bush and Paul Ryan proposed. 

We cannot and we will not stand for that. When I served in the Senate, I helped lead the fight against the Bush privatization scheme. Instead of cutting or privatizing Social Security, we will defend and expand it. 

When President Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act into law, he said it 'represents a cornerstone in a structure which is being built but is by no means completed.' Social Security works, but we can make it better. Millions of women—and men—who are widowed or who take time out of the paid workforce to raise a child or care for a sick family member are being left behind. As President, I'll expand benefits to cover these hardworking Americans, because no one should have to live in poverty because their spouse died or they did the vital work of taking care of a loved one.

889307941125736_1208046065918587,"""Fifty-one years after the Voting Rights Act was signed into law, Americans are now facing the most systematic effort to curtail those rights since the era of Jim Crow. Make no mistake, new voter restriction laws in seventeen states have replaced poll taxes and literacy tests as a thinly veiled attempt to achieve an old objective: disenfranchising African Americans, Latinos, low-income people, young people, and people with disabilities.

""But we are fighting back. Last week, a court struck down North Carolina's voter ID requirement, saying it was designed to 'target African Americans with almost surgical precision.' Similar restrictions have recently been overturned in Wisconsin, Texas, Michigan, North Dakota, and Kansas after courts found they were intended to discriminate as well. 

""This November, the notion that every American has a voice in shaping our future is at stake. Donald Trump supports discriminatory voting restrictions -- and actually claims that without them in place, the results of American elections should be questioned. It's a dangerous attempt to undermine the legitimacy of our democracy. 

""I have a very different view. I believe America is stronger when we expand access to the ballot box, not restrict it. That's why I'll fight to repair the Voting Rights Act, expand early voting, and introduce universal, automatic voter registration.  

""Upon signing the Voting Rights Act in 1965, President Johnson said the right to vote 'is one which no American, true to our principles, can deny.'

""He was right.""

Tim ha luchado toda su vida por causas progresistas y es uno de los candidatos a la vicepresidencia más calificados de la historia de nuestro país. Sin embargo, sus credenciales por sí solas no son el motivo por el que le pedí que estuviera a mi lado.
 
Tim es un hombre de un incansable optimisto, quien cree que cualquier problema tiene una solución si estás dispuesto a trabajar para solucionarlo. Ese compromiso de lograr resultados lo ha distinguido por décadas durante toda su carrera como servidor público.
 
Te podría hacer una larga lista de las cosas que ha cumplido como alcalde de Richmond, gobernador de Virginia y en el Senado de los Estados Unidos. Pero aquí lo más importante: Tim nunca ha tomado un trabajo por el reconocimiento ni por el título. Es la misma persona en frente o detrás de las cámaras y lo motiva la creencia de que puedes hacer una diferencia en la vida de los demás mediante el servicio público.
 
No tomé está decisión a la ligera, he tenido el privilegio de ver dos presidentes y dos vicepresidentes de cerca y quería elegir a alguien que me podrá dar su mejor consejo, mirarme a los ojos y decirme que no está de acuerdo conmigo cuando no lo esté. No obstante, la cualidad más importante que no es tan fácil de encontrar es si la persona puede intervenir en un instante y servir como presidente.

889307941125736_1194869870569540,"I'm thrilled to announce my running mate, Tim Kaine.

Tim is a lifelong fighter for progressive causes and one of the most qualified vice presidential candidates in our nation's history. But his credentials alone aren't why I asked him to run alongside me.

Tim's a man of relentless optimism who believes no problem is unsolvable if you're willing to put in the work. That commitment to delivering results has stayed with him throughout his decades-long career as a public servant.

I could give you a laundry list of things he accomplished as mayor of Richmond, governor of Virginia, and in the United States Senate. But here's what's important: Tim has never taken a job for the glory or the title. He's the same person whether the cameras are on or off, motivated by the belief that you can make a difference in people's lives through public service.

I didn't make this decision lightly. I've had the privilege of seeing two presidents and two vice presidents up close, and I wanted to pick someone who will be able to give me their best advice, look me in the eye, and tell me they disagree with me when they do.

We know the names of other victims, too: Tamir Rice. Sandra Bland. Walter Scott. Dontre Hamilton. Laquan McDonald. Eric Garner. Michael Brown. Freddie Gray. Brandon Tate-Brown. And tragically, we could go on and on. The families of the lost are trying to tell us. We need to listen.  

People are also crying out for criminal justice reform. Families are being torn apart by excessive incarceration. Young people are threatened and humiliated by racial profiling. Children are growing up in homes shattered by prison and poverty. They're trying to tell us. We need to listen.  

Brave police officers are working hard every day to inspire trust and confidence. As we mourn the Dallas police officers who died and pray for those wounded, let's not forget how the Dallas Police Department in particular has earned a reputation for excellence. They've worked hard for years to improve policing and strengthen their bonds with the community. And they've gotten results. Police officers across the country are pouring their hearts into this work, because they know how vital it is to our country. They're trying to tell us. We need to listen.  

People are crying out for relief from gun violence. Things have become so broken in Washington that just to try to get a vote on commonsense gun safety reforms, John Lewis himself had to stage a sit-in on the floor of the House of Representatives. Gun violence is ripping apart people's lives. They're trying to tell us.  We need to listen.  

I know that, just by saying all these things together, I may upset some people. I'm talking about criminal justice reform the day after a horrific attack on police officers. I'm talking about courageous, honorable police officers just a few days after officer-involved killings in Louisiana and Minnesota. I'm bringing up guns in a country where merely talking about comprehensive background checks, limits on assault weapons and the size of ammunition clips gets you demonized.

But all these things can be true at once. We do need police and criminal justice reforms, to save lives and make sure all Americans are treated as equal in rights and dignity. We do need to support police departments and stand up for the men and women who put their lives on the line every day to protect us. We do need to reduce gun violence. We may disagree about how, but surely we can all agree with those basic premises. Surely this week showed us how true they are.",,status,,https://www.facebook.com/hillaryclinton/posts/1183898501666677,2016-07-08 21:31:10,33689,4879,4676,28610,3095,31,32,1739,182

From Staten Island to Baltimore, Ferguson to Baton Rouge, too many African American families mourn the loss of a loved one from a police-involved incident. Something is profoundly wrong when so many Americans have reason to believe that our country doesn't consider them as precious as others because of the color of their skin.

I am glad the Department of Justice has agreed to a full and thorough review of this shooting. Incidents like this one have undermined the trust between police departments and the communities they serve. We need to rebuild that trust. We need to ensure justice is served. That begins with common sense reforms like ending racial profiling, providing better training on de-escalation and implicit bias, and supporting municipalities that refer the investigation and prosecution of police-involved deaths to independent bodies. All over America, there are police officers demonstrating how to protect the public without resorting to unnecessary force. We need to learn from and build on those examples.

Progress is possible if we stand together and never waver in our fight to secure the future that every American deserves.",,status,,https://www.facebook.com/hillaryclinton/posts/1182336195156241,2016-07-06 19:26:37,38033,3860,4212,32705,2039,26,32,3035,196

By overturning restrictions that made it nearly impossible for Texans to exercise their full reproductive rights, the Court has rightfully upheld every woman's fundamental right to safe, legal abortion, no matter where she lives.

To everyone who flooded the Texas Capitol to speak out against these attacks on women's health, to the brave women and men across the country who shared their stories, and to the health care providers who fought for their patients and refused to give up: this victory belongs to you. I applaud you, and I thank you.

But our fight is far from over. In Texas, throughout the South, and across the country, a woman's constitutional right to make her own health decisions is under attack. In the first three months of 2016, states introduced more than 400 measures restricting access to abortion. We've seen a concerted, persistent attack on women's health and rights at the federal level. Meanwhile, Donald Trump has said women should be punished for having abortions—as if women, particularly low-income women and women of color, didn't already face enough barriers to exercising their basic rights. He also pledged to defund Planned Parenthood and appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade.

Today's decision is a reminder of how much is at stake in this election. We need a president who will not only defend women's health and rights—including appointing Supreme Court justices who recognize Roe v. Wade as settled law—but expand them, by overturning the Hyde Amendment, protecting funding for Planned Parenthood, and building on the Affordable Care Act and its benefits for women's health. Above all, today and every day, we need to continue to protect access to safe and legal abortion—not just on paper, but in reality.",,status,,https://www.facebook.com/hillaryclinton/posts/1175666352489892,2016-06-27 09:20:58,50555,3853,3459,45719,4526,126,28,38,118

These are our friends and family members; neighbors and classmates; DREAMers and parents of Americans and lawful permanent residents. They enrich our communities and contribute to our economy every day. I believe that President Obama acted well within his authority in issuing these actions—and as president, I will defend DAPA and DACA, do everything possible under the law to keep families together, and introduce comprehensive immigration reform with a path to full and equal citizenship within my first 100 days. 

The ruling also underscores just how high the stakes are in this election. Republicans' adamant refusal to even consider the president's nominee for the current vacancy on the Supreme Court is hurting our country. They need to stop playing political games with our democracy and give Judge Merrick Garland a fair hearing and vote. It's also a striking reminder of how dangerous a Donald Trump presidency would be: Trump would fully repeal President Obama's executive actions and create a deportation force to round up 11 million undocumented immigrants.

We may have our disagreements on gun safety regulations, but we should all be able to agree on a few things. For one, if the FBI is watching you for suspected terrorist links, you shouldn't be able to just go buy a gun with no questions asked.

Some will say that assault weapons and background checks have nothing to do with terrorism. Well, in Orlando and San Bernardino, terrorists used assault weapons like the AR-15 to kill Americans.

In a democracy, that's how it goes. 
 
But when Bill walked into that office for the very first time as President, that note was waiting for him. It had some good advice about staying focused on what mattered, despite the critics. It wished him happiness. And it concluded with these words:
 
""You will be our President when you read this note. I wish you well. I wish your family well. Your success is now our country's success. And I am rooting hard for you. George.""

889307941125736_1165840096805851,"On Sunday, Americans woke up to a nightmare: Another act of terrorism in a place no one expected it, a man with a gun in his hands and hate in his heart, apparently consumed by rage against LGBT Americans—and, by extension, against the openness and diversity that define our way of life.

No matter how many times we endure attacks like this, the horror never fades. The murder of innocent people always breaks our hearts, tears at our sense of security, and makes us furious. So many of us are praying for everyone who was killed, for the wounded and those still missing, and for all the loved ones grieving today. As a mother, I can't imagine what those families are going through. 

But we owe their memories and their families more than prayer. We must also take decisive action to strengthen our international alliances and combat acts of terror, to keep weapons of war off our streets, and to affirm the rights of LGBT Americans—and all Americans—to feel welcome and safe in our country.

Here's what we absolutely cannot do: We cannot demonize Muslim people. Inflammatory anti-Muslim rhetoric hurts the vast majority of Muslims who love freedom and hate terror. It's no coincidence that hate crimes against American Muslims and mosques tripled after Paris and San Bernardino. Islamophobia goes against everything we stand for as a nation founded on freedom of religion, and it plays right into the terrorists' hands.

We're a big-hearted, fair-minded country. We teach our children that this is one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all—not just for people who look a certain way, or love a certain way, or worship a certain way.

I want to say this to all the LGBT people grieving today in Florida and across our country: You have millions of allies who will always have your back. I am one of them. From Stonewall to Laramie and now Orlando, we've seen too many examples of how the struggle to live freely, openly, and without fear has been marked by violence. We have to stand together. Be proud together. There is no better rebuke to the terrorists and all those who hate.

This fundamentally American idea—that we're stronger together—is why I'm so confident that we can overcome the threats we face, solve our challenges at home, and build a future where no one's left out or left behind.

889307941125736_1159936380729556,"On June 5, 1981, doctors reported the first cases of a mysterious new disease, and understanding of the AIDS crisis in America began—for too long, a quiet, deadly epidemic, that thousands of courageous LGBT people, activists, and allies brought into the spotlight. Since that first day when we learned of the devastating disease that would come to be known as AIDS, we've lost millions of friends and loved ones—some of mine included.

35 years later, we've made tremendous strides in treating and preventing the spread of HIV and AIDS. Thanks to advocates and survivors who refused to accept silence and inaction, countless lives have been saved. I've made this my fight, too: from strategizing with world leaders about how to stop the spread of HIV and AIDS as First Lady, to launching an initiative as secretary of state to usher in an AIDS-free generation through prevention and treatment around the world—this is a battle I will continue to wage, alongside activists and survivors, until we win.

HIV and AIDS still disproportionately threaten communities of color, transgender people, young people, and gay and bisexual men, and millions still live with HIV in the U.S. and around the world. But we have the tools to end this epidemic once and for all, and the next president will play a pivotal role in helping to make an AIDS-free generation a reality. If we work with our partners around the world to invest in research, expand access to health care and education, and dismantle the stigma that hurts people and increases risk, this is a goal we can reach together. I'm determined to do it—we owe it to those we lost, and all future generations, to end the AIDS epidemic in America at last.",,status,,https://www.facebook.com/hillaryclinton/posts/1159936380729556,2016-06-05 19:57:02,10030,1185,1200,8911,772,11,9,311,16

They're not even really ideas—just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds, and outright lies. He is not just unprepared. He is temperamentally unfit to hold an office that requires knowledge, stability, and immense responsibility.

This is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes, because it's not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin. We cannot put the security of our children and grandchildren in Donald Trump's hands. We cannot let him roll the dice with America.

This is a man who said that more countries should have nuclear weapons, including Saudi Arabia. He believes we can treat the U.S. economy like one of his casinos and default on our debts to the rest of the world, which would cause an economic catastrophe far worse than anything we experienced in 2008. He has said that he would order our military to carry out torture and the murder of civilians who are related to suspected terrorists—even though those are war crimes. He says he doesn't have to listen to our generals or our admirals, our ambassadors and other high officials, because he has ""a very good brain."" He says climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese. He praises dictators like Vladimir Putin and picks fights with our friends. He says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the Miss Universe pageant in Russia. And to top it off, he believes America is weak. An embarrassment. He called our military a disaster. He said we are a ""third-world country."" And he's been saying things like that for decades.

Those are the words of someone who doesn't understand America or the world. And they're the words of someone who would lead us in the wrong direction.

And shortly before, when talking about the possibility of a housing market crash, Donald Trump said ""I sort of hope that happens""—because he could make money off of it. How cruel do you have to be to actually root for a crisis that would devastate millions of families, all to pad your own pockets?

This wasn't an anomaly for Trump. His economic plan helps the extremely wealthy and hurts middle-class families. He'd roll back financial regulations and let Wall Street run wild again. Trump prioritizing his own gain over Americans' well-being isn't new, but it is telling: The only person he'll fight for is himself.  

We're not going to let Trump bankrupt America like he bankrupted his companies. We're not going to let him wreck our economy and devastate working families. We're going to protect and build on President Obama's financial reforms to make sure Wall Street can never again threaten Main Street. Trump has proven he'll sell out anyone to make a buck. We need to make sure he never gets the chance.",,status,,https://www.facebook.com/hillaryclinton/posts/1151595928230268,2016-05-24 20:30:05,16838,3432,2076,15228,622,96,32,83,777

So when you say, ""we're going to bar all Muslims,"" you are sending a dangerous message to the Muslim world. And you're also sending a message to the terrorists. If you go through many of Trump's irresponsible, reckless, dangerous comments, it's not just someone saying something off the cuff. We all misstate things occasionally, but this is a pattern—one that has gone on now for months, and one that adds up. Look at the incredibly difficult work that presidents do, and the decisions that they have to make, and the thinking that goes into those decisions. They have to be carefully parsed and analyzed. Advisors and cabinet members give their opinions, but it is up to the president to decide.

The United States presidency isn't just another job; it's the hardest job in the world. It requires steadiness as well as strength and smarts. Consider that, and then consider the things Donald Trump has been saying for the past year, and even just the past week: attacking Great Britain; praising the leader of North Korea, a despotic dictator who has nuclear weapons; saying to let other countries have nuclear weapons; and the list goes on. The kinds of positions he is stating and the consequences of those positions and statements are not just offensive and wrong—they are dangerous.

Now of course, the problem goes far deeper than Donald Trump or Ted Cruz.

There's something wrong, my friends, when the median wealth for black families is a tiny fraction of the median wealth for white families, when African Americans are still more likely to be denied a mortgage.
 
Something's wrong when black kids get arrested for petty crimes but white kids who do the same things don't. 
Something's wrong when gun violence is by far the leading cause of death for young black men, outstripping the next nine causes of death combined. 
Something's wrong when so many black parents are burying their children.
 
Imagine if a white baby in parts of our country was twice as likely to die before her first birthday than a black baby. Imagine the outcry and the resources that would flood in to save those babies.

Even by his impossibly low standards, Trump's suggestion that women be punished for seeking abortion is abhorrent.

Women, especially low-income women and women of color, are already being punished by GOP-led efforts to stigmatize and restrict health care. Every woman—regardless of income or zip code—deserves access to health care. If you don't get that, you have no business being president.

Making a difference in people's lives comes first because Americans everywhere are hungry for solutions. They want to break down the barriers holding them back so we can all rise together.

Ask any parent and you'll hear that nothing is more important than making sure their kids have a good school and a good teacher—no matter what ZIP code they live in. They deserve a president who understands that when we invest in our children's education, we're investing in all of our futures.

Young people across America struggling under the weight of student debt find it difficult to imagine the futures they want, and they deserve a president who will help relieve that burden and help future generations go to college without borrowing a dime for tuition.

Grandparents who worry about retirement deserve a president who will protect and expand Social Security for those who need it most, not cut or privatize it.

Families deserve a president who will fight for the things that are priorities at home but too often aren't priorities in Washington: affordable child care, paid leave, and something we've waited for long enough—equal pay for equal work.

Above all, hard-working Americans across our country deserve a president with both the ideas and the know-how to create good jobs with rising incomes right here in our country. And I am absolutely convinced that we have the tools to do that.",,status,,https://www.facebook.com/hillaryclinton/posts/1097633636959831,2016-03-15 21:21:00,28258,1654,1950,25443,2583,51,20,7,154

But what we're hearing from Donald Trump is something else entirely. Let's just tell the truth about what's going on here. Donald Trump is running a cynical campaign of hate and fear for one reason: to get votes. He's encouraging violence and chaos to get votes. He is pitting Americans against each other to get votes.

Donald Trump says he wants to round up millions of Latino immigrants and kick them out of the United States—a nation built by immigrants. He wants to ban all Muslims from the United States—a country founded on religious freedom. He supports torture, advocates killing the wives and children of our enemies, and had to be told that these are war crimes in violation of international law, our own laws, our most deeply held principles, and our Constitution. And after stoking every fire he can think of, Trump encourages his supporters to beat up anybody who disagrees with him—literally punch them in the face—and then offers to pay their legal bills. 

Now, at our best, Americans have rejected demagogues and fear mongers. You don't make America great by getting rid of everything that made America great in the first place. You and I know Donald Trump is not who we are.

Now, of course, we can criticize and protest Mr. Trump all we want. But none of that matters if we don't also show up at the polls. If you want to shut him down, then let's vote him down.

""Iowa friends, this message is for you!

Lots of people ask me why I'm working so hard to elect Hillary Clinton our next president (and the first female president of the United States). And I tell them it's for people like my mom, who was a teacher in St. Louis for 36 years. I was raised by strong women, and Hillary reminds me of my mom—they're both fighters. And please believe me when I say there is no one who fights harder for American families than Hillary.

And if you want someone who's going to stand up to Republicans to defend the progress that we've made under President Obama—and who's gonna fight for people like my mom and yours—then I'm asking you to caucus for Hillary on Monday night. Let's do this!

One by one, each held up a picture of a beloved child killed by gun violence or by the police. They're not looking for sympathy, they just want to spare other families from what they've endured. And they're turning their grief into a powerful call of action for the nation.

One of those women is named Sybrina Fulton. Her son was Trayvon Martin. When he was killed, she found herself thrust into the national spotlight. I've gotten to know her, and she's a private person. She really didn't want to be a spokesperson for victims of gun violence and their families. She struggled with that for a long time, but after a lot of prayers, she decided she had to act. She said, 'I have to do my part. I have to do something to remember my son. I have to do something to try to make a difference in this world. If you want change, it starts with you.'

And so on this Martin Luther King Day, as we remember this giant from our history, let us also think of Sybrina Fulton and everyone who gets up every morning, and takes a very deep breath, and gets to work trying to make a difference in our country and the world.

People should not have to be afraid to go to college, like this one, or go to the movie theater, or go to bible study. What is wrong with us that we can't stand up to the NRA and the gun lobby and the gun manufacturers they represent? 

You know, this is not just tragic. We don't just need to pray for people. We need to act. And we need to build a movement. It's infuriating. Every time there's another massacre Republicans and the NRA say, now is not the time to talk about guns. Yes, it is. But more than talk, it is time to act.

But Republicans keep refusing to do anything to protect our communities. They put the NRA ahead of American families. It is wrong and we need to make every politician who sides with them to look into the eyes of parents whose children have been murdered and explain why they listen to the gun lobbyist instead.

Now, I am well aware that this is a political mountain to climb. But you don't get anything done in this country if you don't start by calling it out. And we have had too many murders, too many people who should have never gotten guns in the first place taking out whatever their rage, their fury, their mental problems are by killing other people. And I will, as your president, never relent on trying to work on this."" -Hillary today in Florida",,status,,https://www.facebook.com/hillaryclinton/posts/991681777555018,2015-10-02 16:07:16,39000,5482,4308,39000,0,0,0,0,0

It's bad enough to see hateful rhetoric and lies in a presidential debate. But just like the candidates on stage last night, Republicans in Congress want to defund Planned Parenthood. And they're willing to shut down the federal government to do it, no matter how bad that is for our country. That's how far they'll go to stop an organization that provides 500,000 breast exams, 400,000 pap tests, and 4.5 million STD tests every year. 
 
Repeating false statements doesn't make them true, no matter how many times you do it. Defunding a trusted health care provider that serves one in five women in America doesn't help anyone – in fact, it would hurt hundreds of thousands of people. Speaker Boehner and his colleagues have a job to do, and they should do it. Here's my message to them: Don't attack women's health care.

It's important for you to know a few key facts. My use of a personal email account was aboveboard and allowed under the State Department's rules. Everyone I communicated with in government was aware of it. And nothing I ever sent or received was marked classified at the time. 

As this process proceeds, I want to be as transparent as possible. That's why I've provided all of my work emails to the government to be released to the public, and why I'll be testifying in public in front of the Benghazi Committee later next month.

I know this is a complex story. I could have—and should have—done a better job answering questions earlier. I'm grateful for your support, and I'm not taking anything for granted.

So, here's a new plan: We're going to create a scholarship program for student parents, called SPARK—Student Parents in America Raising Kids. It will give extra financial help for student parents who keep their grades up. It's not a lot of money, but it's enough to help pay for gas or a babysitter—just the kind of extra help that can keep somebody in school. 

We're also going to significantly increase access to quality childcare on college campuses. Childcare centers already exist on some campuses, but a lot of parents don't have any safe, affordable place to leave their kids while they go to school. 

The financial benefits of all this are clear: Students with college degrees can earn more than a half a million dollars over their lifetimes more than students with high school degrees. When a parent is able to get that education that so many parents work for, it really makes a difference. This is going to be good for kids, for students, and for parents.

What a lot of the men on that stage in the debate said was offensive: some very radical and offensive positions when it comes to women's lives, women's reproductive health, women's opportunities. 
 
When one of the GOP's major candidates, Marco Rubio, says there should be no exceptions for rape and incest in a ban on abortion, that is as offensive and as troubling a comment as you can hear from a major candidate running for the presidency. The language may be more colorful and more offensive when it comes from one candidate, but the thinking, and the attitude, toward women is very much the same as the rest—it's just delivered in a different package. What they say about women should not be forgotten. 

So yes, it makes great TV. Trump went way overboard: offensive, outrageous, pick your adjective. But what Rubio said has as much of an impact in terms of where the Republican party is today as anybody else on that stage.
